## Setup

I recommend setting up a python venv.

Install the required packages and libraries

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To additionally install all packages and libraries required for testing

```shell
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

## Hooks

Install the pre-commit package manager:

```shell
pip install pre-commit
```

Install the git hook scripts

```shell
pre-commit install
```

now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit `.

## Tests

Run tests

```shell
pytest test/
```

## Documentation

The documentation of this project can be read [here](https://jakobeliaswagner.github.io/Neural-Operators/index.html).

To install the necessary tools to build the documentation

```shell
pip install sphinx
```

To build the documentation locally run

```shell
sphinx-build -M html doc/source doc/build
```

The build documentation can then be found in `doc/build/html`. Open the `index.html` to access it.
However, the local build of the documentation does not have access to the code-coverage report as this report is
generated by a GitHub pipeline.

To update the documentation on the current API

```shell
sphinx-apidoc -f -o doc/source/ src/
```
