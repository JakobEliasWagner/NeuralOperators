Introduction
============

The Helmholtz equation is a fundamental partial differential equation in physics, particularly in the fields of acoustics, electromagnetics, and quantum mechanics. In this project, we develop and utilize neural operators, a form of deep learning model, to solve the Helmholtz equation across different parameterized geometries. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical methods, offering speed and flexibility for complex geometries.
